Thanks to [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpWFrUwAN88&lc=UgydY88D4th7GgNYYXZ4AaABAg][Jeremy Ward]]

** Getting Started

- Ruby: 3.2.2
- Rails: 7.0.4.3

  I needed to add gem 'redis' to Gemfile in order to make ActionCable works on Heroku

- I also needed to install [[https://github.com/libvips/libvips][vips]] for ActionText handle attached images.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ sudo apt install libvips
$ git clone https://github.com/acdesouza/demo_rails_7.git
$ rvm install "ruby-3.2.2"
$ cd demo_rails_7
$ bundle
$ rails db:reset
$ rails server
#+END_SRC
